Actions w_i
w_place_bomb # Unsure how this will be used
w_monster # multiplied by Scalar / (A* distance from monster probably)

# Might have an array for this, or will just be a multiplicative factor?
w_move_x # weight of moving -1, 0, +1 in x
w_move_y # weight of moving -1, 0, +1 in y
# Might also just be an array of 9, and we'll still be multiplying by the next A* step (or at least how close we get to it next)
# Will be multiplied by the vertical, horizontala distance from goal, and probably also the A* distance from goal? - f_move, f_distance_from_goal, etc

States f_i
# We will have an array of size 9 to select which move we can do?
f_move # each of our moves percentage chance, so if we are up against a wall its a 0 chance

f_distance_from_goal # A* distance from goal
f_distance_from_goal_x # Vertical distance from goal
f_distance_from_goal_y # Horizontal distance from goal
# These last two might also be the next step torwards goal given by A*?

# Multiple monsters means below will have to be a list probably, and each instance of monster also warrants the possible actions they can take as well?
f_distance_from_monster # A* distance from monster
f_distance_from_monster_x # Vertical distance from monster
f_distance_from_monster_y # Horizontal distance from monster

f_distance_from_bomb_x # Vertical distance from closest bomb explosion in the x
f_distance_from_bomb_y # Horizontal distance from closest bomb explosion in the y
# These will probably be multiplied by 1 / (how long until the bomb explodes)

Rewards
-1 for each move
-500 for dying
+10 for destroying a wall
+50 for destroying a monster
+500 for reaching goal
